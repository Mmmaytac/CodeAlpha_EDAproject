## 🛒 Amazon Sales Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an Amazon sales dataset.
The goal is to explore, understand, and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights that can help improve business decisions related to product performance, customer behavior, and sales strategy.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main purpose of this task is to apply data exploration techniques to:

Understand the structure and distribution of Amazon sales data.

Identify key trends, patterns, and outliers.

Form hypotheses about factors influencing sales.

Validate assumptions using statistics and data visualization.

Detect and document potential data quality issues.

## 📊 Steps Followed
1. Asking Meaningful Questions

Before starting the analysis, several key questions were defined to guide the exploration process:

Which product categories generate the highest sales?

How do sales vary by region, month, or customer type?

What is the relationship between discount rate and revenue?

Which products or categories have declining performance?

Are there any unusual data patterns or outliers in price or quantity sold?

2. Understanding Data Structure

Explored the dataset’s structure and main features, including:

Variables: Product name, Category, Region, Date, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, etc.

Data Types: Checked for numeric, categorical, and datetime columns.

Missing Values: Identified and handled missing or inconsistent entries.

3. Data Exploration & Visualization

Applied various statistical and visual techniques to better understand the dataset:

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)

Correlation matrix to examine relationships between variables

Distribution plots and boxplots for outlier detection

Time series plots to identify monthly or seasonal sales patterns

Bar charts and pie charts for category-level comparisons

## 📈 Visualization tools:
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
